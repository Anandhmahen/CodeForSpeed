In most cases, the browser will automatically redirect http to https. But if you want to directly access http, you can do the following:

1. Go to the below address for accessing the HSTS settings -> 
    Edge
        edge://net-internals/#hsts
    Chrome
        chrome://net-internals/#hsts

2. Look for the following heading:
    Delete domain security policies

3. Enter the domain you want to reset the http -> https redirection and press the Delete button

Now you can access http://<your-domain> directly.
